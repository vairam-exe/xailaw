### **XAI-Driven Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought Explanation):**

"I arrived at this conclusion by analyzing the key legal provisions that regulate the privacy of electronic communications in India. First, I identified that recording a call without consent directly conflicts with the provisions of the Indian Telegraph Act (Section 5), which restricts unauthorized interception. Then, I mapped this to the IT Act 66E, which explicitly penalizes privacy violations in digital communications. I also considered the possibility of defamation under IPC Section 500 if the uploaded content harms someone‚Äôs reputation. The absence of a standalone data privacy law in India means these laws collectively govern privacy-related offenses. This layered analysis ensures that the legal implications are thoroughly considered, leading to the final verdict that uploading such a recording without consent is illegal."
